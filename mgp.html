   <!--There reason for this style section was because when this was attempted in the CSS file the 
      background would not appear, and would just display the default white background. Firstly the code
      was in the CSS and would display beautifully when live previewed in Brackets, but then when uploaded
      to GitHub and live previewed in GitHub pages, the background would not display-->

         <p1>After a long research on current User Interfaces, this was one out of many interfaces which influenced the end product. The reasoning behind deciding that the <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> User Interface was one of the <b>best</b> out of the interfaces researched, was because as Twitter is one of the leading social media platforms across the globe, they would maintain their UI <b><i>user-friendly and current</i></b> as possible in order for their customers to receive the utmost user experience.<br><br> Similarities between the end-product and Twitter's UI can be seen as my name was placed in the corner of the page similar to Twitter's bird logo, which once clicked on, the webpage directs the user back to the Index page.<br><br>Another similarity between the end-product and the Twitter interface being shown, is that the navigation bar was also placed in a similar manner. This allows users to view content within the interface accurately and neatly, as it is important for the elements in an interface for the website to be seen organised and structured. Having an interface that is not structured and organised, users would not spend their time on your website figuring out how it works as it does not look professional. Having a good navigation bar would increase the amount of users to your website, as having an user friendly interface design would most likely make them come back.
