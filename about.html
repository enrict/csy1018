   <!--There reason for this style section was because when this was attempted in the CSS file the 
      background would not appear, and would just display the default white background. Firstly the code
      was in the CSS and would display beautifully when live previewed in Brackets, but then when uploaded
      to GitHub and live previewed in GitHub pages, the background would not display-->

         <h2>Hey there,</h2>
         <p1><i>Want to know more about me? Well, I am..</i><br><br>
            A multi-skilled creative professional, who is passionate about the world of computing. I am energetic, motivated and adaptive, and I have gained knowledge through the combination of experience and academic study, which has incremented the value of my skills. In the near future, I hope to achieve further knowledge and gain more experience in order to become a freelance front-end developer, which I am looking forward to.<br><br> 
            I'm currently a student at the University of Northampton, studying General Computing during my first year. I became interested in computing from a very young age as some of my relatives would tend to fix computers or even create computers, which as I grew older, piqued my interest.<br><br>
